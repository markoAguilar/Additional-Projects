## NASA Space Apps Challenge – ISpyFire
**Award**: 1st Place Global Nominee
**Technologies**: Arduino, Node MCU Chip, Various sensors
**Description**: iSpyFire aims to detect fires at a much quicker rate than satellite by acting as an instant trip wire mechanism. To do this we used multiple sensors such as a temperature/ humidity sensor and a flame sensor that will be reading in live data from the environment. This data is then received and transmitted as a wifi network SSID through a node MCU chip.
